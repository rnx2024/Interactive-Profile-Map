This is an interactive Mapped Profile Info of Philippine Presidential Candidates and Presidents. 
The dataset used is from Abe Caesar Perez of Kaggle.com <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/ph-presidential-elections>

I have only extracted Presidential Candidates with complete information. I have not included 42 candidates from the dataset because of essential missing information such as city, province aand others. 
I have also added two additional columns for the dataset, lat and lng to map city locations on the leaflet map used. 

I have used the leaflet and htmltools packages in creating this interactive map. I have created this file to aid History students in their lessons and History teachers to have a more interactive tool in teaching History to their students. This can be useful as the Philippine Midterm Elections is upcoming this May 2025.

Anyone can use the code and make changes as long as this original repository is referenced.
